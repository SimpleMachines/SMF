	/**
	 * Parses a body in order to see if there are any mentions, returns possible mention names
	 *
	 * Names are tagged by "@<username>" format in post, but they can contain
	 * any type of character up to 60 characters length. So we extract, starting from @
	 * up to 60 characters in length (or if we encounter a line break) and make
	 * several combination of strings after splitting it by anything that's not a word and join
	 * by having the first word, first and second word, first, second and third word and so on and
	 * search every name.
	 *
	 * One potential problem with this is something like "@Admin Space" can match
	 * "Admin Space" as well as "Admin", so we sort by length in descending order.
	 * One disadvantage of this is that we can only match by one column, hence I've chosen
	 * real_name since it's the most obvious.
	 *
	 * If there's an @ symbol within the name, it is counted in the ongoing string and a new
	 * combination string is started from it as well in order to account for all the possibilities.
	 * This makes the @ symbol to not be required to be escaped
	 *
	 * @static
	 * @access protected
	 * @param string $body The text to look for mentions in
	 * @return array An array of names of members who have been mentioned
