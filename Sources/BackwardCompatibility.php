	/**
	 * Provides a way to export a class's public static properties and methods
	 * to global namespace.
	 *
	 * To do so:
	 *
	 *  1. Use this trait in the class.
	 *  2. At the *END* of the class's file, call its exportStatic() method.
	 *
	 * Although it might not seem that way at first glance, this approach
	 * conforms to section 2.3 of PSR 1, since executing this method is simply a
	 * dynamic means of declaring functions when the file is included; it has no
	 * other side effects.
	 *
	 * Regarding the $backcompat items:
	 *
	 * A class's static properties are not exported to global variables unless
	 * explicitly included in $backcompat['prop_names'].
	 *
	 * $backcompat['prop_names'] is a simple array where the keys are the names
	 * of one or more of a class's static properties, and the values are the
	 * names of global variables. In each case, the global variable will be set
	 * to a reference to the static property. Static properties that are not
	 * named in this array will not be exported.
	 *
	 * Adding non-static properties to the $backcompat arrays will produce
	 * runtime errors. It is the responsibility of the developer to make sure
	 * not to do this.
